Given an almost sorted array where only two elements are swapped, how to sort the array efficiently?

Example

Input:  arr[] = {10, 20, 60, 40, 50, 30}  
// 30 and 60 are swapped
Output: arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}

Input:  arr[] = {10, 20, 40, 30, 50, 60}  
// 30 and 40 are swapped
Output: arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}

Input:   arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
// 3 and 5 are swapped
Output:  arr[] = {1, 3, 5}
Expected time complexity is O(n) and only one swap operation to fix the array.
