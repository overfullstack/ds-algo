Find the element that appears once in a sorted array
Given a sorted array in which all elements appear twice (one after one) and one element appears only once. Find that element in O(log n) complexity.

Example:

Input:   arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8}
Output:  4

Input:   arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8}
Output:  8
