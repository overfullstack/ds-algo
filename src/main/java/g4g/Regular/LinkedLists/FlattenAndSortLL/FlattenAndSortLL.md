Flattening a Linked List
Given a linked list where every node represents a linked list and contains two pointers of its type:
(i) Pointer to next node in the main list (we call it ‘right’ pointer in below code)
(ii) Pointer to a linked list where this node is head (we call it ‘down’ pointer in below code).
All linked lists are sorted. See the following example

       5 -> 10 -> 19 -> 28
       |    |     |     |
       V    V     V     V
       7    20    22    35
       |          |     |
       V          V     V
       8          50    40
       |                |
       V                V
       30               45
Write a function flatten() to flatten the lists into a single linked list. The flattened linked list should also be sorted.
For example, for the above input list, output list should be 5->7->8->10->19->20->22->28->30->35->40->45->50.
