Write a function to get the intersection point of two Linked Lists. There are two singly linked
lists in a system. By some programming error the end node of one of the linked list got linked into
the second list, forming a inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked
list merge.

Y ShapedLinked List Above diagram shows an example with two linked list having 15 as intersection
point.
