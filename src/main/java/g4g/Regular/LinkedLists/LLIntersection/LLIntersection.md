Write a function to get the intersection point of two Linked Lists.
There are two singly linked lists in a system. By some programming error the end node of one of the linked list got linked into the second list, forming a inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked list merge.

Above diagram shows an example with two linked list having 15 as intersection point.
