Given a Binary Tree, find vertical sum of the nodes that are in same vertical line. Print all sums through different vertical lines.

Examples:

      1
    /   \
  2      3
 / \    / \
4   5  6   7
The tree has 5 vertical lines

Vertical-Line-1 has only one node 4 => vertical sum is 4
Vertical-Line-2: has only one node 2=> vertical sum is 2
Vertical-Line-3: has three nodes: 1,5,6 => vertical sum is 1+5+6 = 12
Vertical-Line-4: has only one node 3 => vertical sum is 3
Vertical-Line-5: has only one node 7 => vertical sum is 7

So expected output is 4, 2, 12, 3 and 7
