Given a matrix where every cell has some number of coins. 
Count number of ways to reach bottom right from top left with exactly k coins.
We can move to (i+1, j) and (i, j+1) from a cell (i, j).

Example:

Input:  k = 12
        mat[][] = { {1, 2, 3},
                    {4, 6, 5},
                    {3, 2, 1}
                  };
Output:  2
There are two paths with 12 coins
1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1
