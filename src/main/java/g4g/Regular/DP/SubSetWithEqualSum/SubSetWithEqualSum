Partition problem is to determine whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is same.

Examples

arr[] = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: true
The array can be partitioned as {1, 5, 5} and {11}

arr[] = {1, 5, 3}
Output: false
The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum sets.
