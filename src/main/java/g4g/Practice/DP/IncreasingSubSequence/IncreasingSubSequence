Dynamic Programming | Set 3 (Longest Increasing Subsequence)
We have discussed Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Substructure properties in Set 1 and Set 2 respectively.

Let us discuss Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem as an example problem that can be solved using Dynamic Programming.
The longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that
all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
For example, length of LIS for { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.

Given a sequence, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence from a given sequence .
The longest increasing subsequence means to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest
to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.

Note: Duplicate numbers are not counted as increasing subsequence.

For example:
 length of LIS for
{ 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.



Input:

The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases.
Then following T lines contains an integer N depicting the size of array and next line followed by the value of array.


Output:

Print the Max length of the subsequence in a separate line.


Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 300

0 8 4 12 2 10 6 14 1 9 5 13 3 11 7 15
Output
