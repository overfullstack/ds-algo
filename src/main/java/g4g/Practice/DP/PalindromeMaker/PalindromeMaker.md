Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to convert it to palindrome.

Before we go further, let us understand with few examples:
    ab: Number of insertions required is 1. bab
    aa: Number of insertions required is 0. aa
    abcd: Number of insertions required is 3. dcbabcd
    abcda: Number of insertions required is 2. adcbcda which is same as number of insertions in the substring bcd(Why?).
    abcde: Number of insertions required is 4. edcbabcde

Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to convert it to palindrome.
For Example:
ab: Number of insertions required is 1. bab or aba
aa: Number of insertions required is 0. aa
abcd: Number of insertions required is 3. dcbabcd

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is S.

Output:

Print the minimum number of characters.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ S ≤ 40

Example:

Input:
3
abcd
aba

Output:
