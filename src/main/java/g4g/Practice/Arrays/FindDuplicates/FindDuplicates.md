Duplicates in an array in O(n) and by using O(1) extra space | Set-2
Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. 
Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.

For example, let n be 7 and array be {1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6}, the answer should be 1, 3 and 6.
We have discussed an approach for this question in below post:
Duplicates in an array in O(n) and by using O(1) extra space | Set-2.
There is a problem in above approach. It prints the repeated number more than once. For example: {1, 6, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6} it will give output as : 3 6 6. So, in this article, another method is discussed to overcome this problem.

Given an array A[], Your task is to complete the function printDuplicates which prints the duplicate elements of the given array. If no duplicate element is found  print -1.

Note: Auxiliary Space must be O(1) and time complexity must be O(n).

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N which denotes number of elements of Array. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting elements of Array A[].

Output:
Print the duplicate elements from the array.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=50
0<=A[]<=N

Example:
Input:
2
4
0 3 1 2
5
2 3 1 2 3 
Output:
-1
2 3
