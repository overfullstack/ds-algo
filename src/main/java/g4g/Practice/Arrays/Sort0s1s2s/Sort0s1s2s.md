Given an array A[] consisting 0s, 1s and 2s, write a function that sorts A[]. The functions should put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.
Examples:

Input :  {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}
Output : {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}

Input :  {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1}
Output : {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}

Write a program to sort an array of 0's,1's and 2's in ascending order.

Input:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the total number of test cases. In each test cases, First line is number of elements in array 'N' and second its values.

Output: 
Print the sorted array of 0's, 1's and 2's.

Constraints: 

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
0 <= arr[i] <= 2

Example:

Input :

2
5
0 2 1 2 0
3
0 1 0
 

Output:

0 0 1 2 2
0 0 1
