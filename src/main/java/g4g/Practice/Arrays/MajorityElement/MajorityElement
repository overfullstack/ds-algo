Majority Element
Majority Element: A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).

Write a function which takes an array and emits the majority element (if it exists), otherwise prints NONE as follows:

       I/P : 3 3 4 2 4 4 2 4 4
       O/P : 4 

       I/P : 3 3 4 2 4 4 2 4
       O/P : NONE

Write a program to find the majority element in the array.
A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element).
If input array doesn't contain a majority element, then output "NO Majority Element"

Input:  The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. The first line of the test case will be the size of array and second line will be the elements of the array.
Output: For each test case the output will be the majority element of the array.
Constraints:

1 <=T<= 100

1 <=N<= 100

0 <= a[i]<= 100


Example:

Input:

2
5
3 1 3 3 2
3
1 2 3

Output:
3
NO Majority Element
