Given an array of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order, write a function that returns a Fixed Point in the array, if there is any Fixed Point present in array, else returns -1. Fixed Point in an array is an index i such that arr[i] is equal to i. Note that integers in array can be negative.

Examples:

  Input: arr[] = {-10, -5, 0, 3, 7}
  Output: 3  // arr[3] == 3 

  Input: arr[] = {0, 2, 5, 8, 17}
  Output: 0  // arr[0] == 0 


  Input: arr[] = {-10, -5, 3, 4, 7, 9}
  Output: -1  // No Fixed Point


Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to find that element whose value is equal to that of its index value.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N, size of array. The second line of each test case contains array elements.

Output:
Print the element whose value is equal to index value. Print "Not Found" when index value does not match with value.
Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have same value as their index. You need to print every such element's index separated by a single space. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:
Input:
2
5
15 2 45 12 7
1
1

Output:
2
1
