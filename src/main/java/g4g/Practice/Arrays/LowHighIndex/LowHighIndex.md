Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array
Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5 ,67, 123, 125}    
        x = 5
Output : First Occurrence = 2
         Last Occurrence = 5

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5 ,7, 123 ,125 }    
        x = 7
Output : First Occurrence = 6
         Last Occurrence = 6
         

Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array just print '-1'.

Input:
The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x. 
The second line contains n spaced integers.

Output:
Print index of the first and last occurrences of the number x with a space in between.

Constraints: 
1<=T<=100
1<=n,a[i]<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
9 5
1 3 5 5 5 5 67 123 125
9 7
1 3 5 5 5 5 7 123 125

Output:
2 5
6 6
