Median of two sorted arrays
Question: There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n))

Sum of Middle Elements of two sorted arrays
array      Amazon
Given 2 sorted arrays A and B of size N each. Print sum of middle elements of the array obtained after merging the given arrays.

Input:
The first line contains 'T' denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases.
Each case begins with a single positive integer N denoting the size of array.
The second line contains the N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array A.
The third line contains N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array B.
 

Output:

For each testcase, print the sum of middle elements of two sorted arrays. The number of the elements in the merged array are even so there will be 2 numbers in the center n/2 and n/2 +1. You have to print their sum. 


Constraints:
 1<=T<=50
 1<=N<=1000
 1<=A[i]<=100000
 1<=B[i]<=100000


Example:
Input :
1
5
1 2 4 6 10
4 5 6 9 12
 
Output : 
11
