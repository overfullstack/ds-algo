Diagonal Traversal of Binary Tree
Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal elements in a binary tree belonging to same line.

Input : Root of below tree

 Given a Binary Tree, print the diagonal traversal of the binary tree.

 Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal elements in a binary tree belonging to same line.

 Input : Root of below tree
 unnamed

 Output :
 Diagonal Traversal of binary tree :
  8 10 14 3 6 7 13 1 4

 Input:
 The task is to complete the method which takes 1 argument, root of Binary Tree. The struct Node has a data part which stores the data, pointer to left child and pointer to right child.
 There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

 Output:
 The function should print out the diagonal traversal of the binary tree.

 Constraints:
 1 <=T<= 30
 1 <= Number of nodes<= 100
 1 <= Data of a node<= 1000

 Example:

 Input
 2
 2
 1 2 R 1 3 L
 4
 10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

 Output
 1 2 3
 10 30 20 60 40

 There are two test casess.  First case represents a tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.   Second test case represents a tree with 4 edges and 5 nodes.
