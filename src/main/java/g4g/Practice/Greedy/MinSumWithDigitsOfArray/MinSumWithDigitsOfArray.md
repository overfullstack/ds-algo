Minimum sum of two numbers formed from digits of an array
Given an array of digits (values are from 0 to 9), find the minimum possible sum of two numbers formed from digits of the array. All digits of given array must be used to form the two numbers.

Input: [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3]
Output: 604
The minimum sum is formed by numbers
358 and 246

Input: [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]
Output: 82
The minimum sum is formed by numbers
35 and 047

Given an array of digits (values are from 0 to 9), find the minimum possible sum of two numbers formed from digits of the array. All digits of given array must be used to form the two numbers.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Next line of each test contains N space seperated integers denoting the elements of the array.
Output:

For each test case output a single line containing the required sum.
Constraints:

1<=T<=100
1<=N<=50
Example:

Input

2
6
6 8 4 5 2 3
5
