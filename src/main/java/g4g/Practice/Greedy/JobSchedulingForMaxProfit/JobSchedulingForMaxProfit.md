Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the deadline. It is also given that every job takes single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. How to maximize total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.

Examples:

Input: Four Jobs with following deadlines and profits
  JobID    Deadline      Profit
    a        4            20   
    b        1            10
    c        1            40  
    d        1            30
Output: Following is maximum profit sequence of jobs
        c, a   


Input:  Five Jobs with following deadlines and profits
   JobID     Deadline     Profit
     a         2           100
     b         1           19
     c         2           27
     d         1           25
     e         3           15
Output: Following is maximum profit sequence of jobs
        c, a, e
        
Given a set of n jobs where each job i has a deadline and profit associated to it. Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit if and only if the job is completed by its deadline. The task is to find the maximum profit and the number of jobs done.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consist of an integer N denoting the number of jobs and the next line consist of Job id, 
Deadline and the Profit associated to that Job.

Output:
Output the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
1<=Deadline<=100
1<=Profit<=500

Example:
Input:
2
4
1 4 20 2 1 10 3 1 40 4 1 30
5
1 2 100 2 1 19 3 2 27 4 1 25 5 1 15

Output:
2 60
2 127
