Remove minimum elements from either side such that 2*min becomes more than max
Given an unsorted array, trim the array such that twice of minimum is greater than maximum in the trimmed array.
Elements should be removed either end of the array.

Number of removals should be minimum.

Examples:

arr[] = {4, 5, 100, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 200}
Output: 4
We need to remove 4 elements (4, 5, 100, 200)
so that 2*min becomes more than max.


arr[] = {4, 7, 5, 6}
Output: 0
We don't need to remove any element as 
4*2 > 7 (Note that min = 4, max = 8)

arr[] = {20, 7, 5, 6}
Output: 1
We need to remove 20 so that 2*min becomes
more than max

arr[] = {20, 4, 1, 3}
Output: 3
We need to remove any three elements from ends
like 20, 4, 1 or 4, 1, 3 or 20, 3, 1 or 20, 4, 1

Given an unsorted array, trim the array such that twice of minimum is greater than maximum in the trimmed array. Elements should be removed either end of the array. Number of removals should be minimum.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is N,N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N input A[i],numbers in array.

Output:

Print the minimum number of removals.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:

Output
4
