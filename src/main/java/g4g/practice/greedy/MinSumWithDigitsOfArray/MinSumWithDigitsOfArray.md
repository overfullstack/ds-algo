Minimum sum of two numbers formed from digits of an array Given an array of digits (values are from
0 to 9), find the minimum possible sum of two numbers formed from digits of the array. All digits of
given array must be used to form the two numbers.

Input: [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3]
Output: 604 The minimum sum is formed by numbers 358 and 246

Input: [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]
Output: 82 The minimum sum is formed by numbers 35 and 047

Given an array of digits (values are from 0 to 9), find the minimum possible sum of two numbers
formed from digits of the array. All digits of given array must be used to form the two numbers.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases
follow. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Next line
of each test contains N space seperated integers denoting the elements of the array. Output:

For each test case output a single line containing the required sum. Constraints:

1<=T<=100 1<=N<=50 Example:

Input

2 6 6 8 4 5 2 3 5 5 3 0 7 4

Output

604 82

Explanation:

Test Case 1-

The minimum sum is formed by numbers 358 and 246 Test Case 2 -

The minimum sum is formed by numbers 35 and 047
