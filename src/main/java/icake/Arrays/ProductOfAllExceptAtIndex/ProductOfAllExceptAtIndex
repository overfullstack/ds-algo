You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
Write a function getProductsOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex()() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

For example, given:

  [1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

  [84, 12, 28, 21]
