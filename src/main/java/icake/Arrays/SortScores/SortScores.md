You created a game that is more popular than Angry Birds.

You rank players in the game from highest to lowest score. So far you're using an algorithm that
sorts in O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time, but players are complaining that their rankings aren't updated fast
enough. You need a faster sorting algorithm.

Write a function that takes:

an array of unsortedScores the highestPossibleScore in the game and returns a sorted array of scores
in less than O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time.
