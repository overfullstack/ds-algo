Question 31 A robot starts at cell (0, 0) of a grid with m rows and n columns. It can move to the left, right, up, and down, and moves one cell for a step. It cannot enter cells where the digit sum of the row index and column index are greater than a given k.
For example, when k is 18, the robot can reach cell (35, 37) because 3+5+3+7=18. However, it cannot reach cell (35, 38) because 3+5+3+8=19 and that is greater than k. How many cells can the robot reach?
