Sort an array according to the order defined by another array
Given two arrays A1[] and A2[], sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those are in A2.
For the elements not present in A2, append them at last in sorted order.

Input: A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
       A2[] = {2, 1, 8, 3}
Output: A1[] = {2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
The code should handle all cases like number of elements in A2[] may be more or less compared to A1[].
A2[] may have some elements which may not be there in A1[] and vice versa is also possible.

Given two array A1[] and A2[], sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those are in A2.
For the elements not present in A2. Append them at last in sorted order.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is M and N,M is the number of elements in A1 and N is the number of elements in A2.
The second line of each test case contains M elements.
The third line of each test case contains N elements.
Output:

Print the sorted array according order defined by another array.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ M ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 10 & N ≤ M
1 ≤ A1[i], A2[i] ≤ 1000

Example:

Input:
1
11 4
2 1 2 5 7 1 9 3 6 8 8
2 1 8 3

Output:
2 2 1 1 8 8 3 5 6 7 9
