Median of two sorted arrays Question: There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an
algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays(i.e. array of
length 2n). The complexity should be O(log(n))

Sum of Middle Elements of two sorted arrays array Amazon Given 2 sorted arrays A and B of size N
each. Print sum of middle elements of the array obtained after merging the given arrays.

Input:
The first line contains 'T' denoting the number of testcase. Then follows description of testcase.
Each case begins with a single positive integer N denoting the size of array. The second line
contains the N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array A. The third line
contains N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array B.

Output:

For each testcase, print the sum of middle elements of two sorted arrays. The number of the elements
in the merged array are even so there will be 2 numbers in the center n/2 and n/2 +1. You have to
print their sum.

Constraints:
1<=T<=50 1<=N<=1000 1<=A[i]<=100000 1<=B[i]<=100000

Example:
Input :
1 5 1 2 4 6 10 4 5 6 9 12

Output :
11
