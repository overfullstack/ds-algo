Given an unsorted array of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array
elements as three sides of triangles. For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any two values (or sides)
must be greater than the third value (or third side).
For example, if the input array is {4, 6, 3, 7}, the output should be 3. There are three triangles possible
{3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}. Note that {3, 4, 7} is not a possible triangle.
As another example, consider the array {10, 21, 22, 100, 101, 200, 300}. There can be 6 possible triangles:
{10, 21, 22}, {21, 100, 101}, {22, 100, 101}, {10, 100, 101}, {100, 101, 200} and {101, 200, 300}

Given an unsorted array of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles.

Input:
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. First line of test case is the length of array N and second line of test case are its elements.

Output:
Number of possible triangles are displayed to the user.

Constraints:

1 <=T<= 100
3 <=N<= 100
1 <=arr[i]<= 1000


Example:

Input:
2
3
3 5 4
5
6 4 9 7 8

Output:
1
10
