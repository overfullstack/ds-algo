Leaders in an array Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if
it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader.
For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2.

Let the input array be arr[] and size of the array be size.

Leaders in an array array Payu Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is
leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a
leader.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size
of array. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements
of the array.

Output:
Print all the leaders.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100 0 <= A[i]<=100

Example:
Input:
2 6 16 17 4 3 5 2 5 1 2 3 4 0 Output:
17 5 2 4 0
