Count all possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix
The problem is to freq all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints
that from each cell you can either move only to right or down

---

The problem is to freq all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a MxN matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is M and N, M is number of rows and N is number of columns.

Output:

Print the number of paths.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 30
1 ≤ M,N ≤ 10

Example:

Input
2
3 3
2 8

Output
6
8
