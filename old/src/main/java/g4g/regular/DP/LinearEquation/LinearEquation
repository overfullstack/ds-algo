Find number of solutions of a linear equation of n variables
Given a linear equation of n variables, find number of non-negative integer solutions of it. For example,let the given equation be “x + 2y = 5″, solutions of this equation are “x = 1, y = 2″, “x = 5, y = 0″ and “x = 1. It may be assumed that all coefficients in given equation are positive integers.

Example:

Input:  coeff[] = {1, 2}, rhs = 5
Output: 3
The equation "x + 2y = 5" has 3 solutions.
(x=3,y=1), (x=1,y=2), (x=5,y=0)

Input:  coeff[] = {2, 2, 3}, rhs = 4
Output: 3
The equation "2x + 2y + 3z = 4"  has 3 solutions.
(x=0,y=2,z=0), (x=2,y=0,z=0), (x=1,y=1,z=0)
