Given a binary matrix, find out the maximum size square sub-matrix with all 1s.

For example, consider the below binary matrix.

 
   0  1  1  0  1 
   1  1  0  1  0 
   0  1  1  1  0
   1  1  1  1  0
   1  1  1  1  1
   0  0  0  0  0
The maximum square sub-matrix with all set bits is

    1  1  1
    1  1  1
    1  1  1
