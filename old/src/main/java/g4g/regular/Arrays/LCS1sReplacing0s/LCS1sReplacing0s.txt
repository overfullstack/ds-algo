Given an array of 0s and 1s, find the position of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get longest continuous sequence of 1s. Expected time complexity is O(n) and auxiliary space is O(1).
Example:

Input: 
   arr[] =  {1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output:
  Index 9
Assuming array index starts from 0, replacing 0 with 1 at index 9 causes
the maximum continuous sequence of 1s.

Input: 
   arr[] =  {1, 1, 1, 1, 0}
Output:
  Index 4
