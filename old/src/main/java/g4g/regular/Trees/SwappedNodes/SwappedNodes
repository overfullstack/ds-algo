Two of the nodes of a Binary Search Tree (BST) are swapped. Fix (or correct) the BST.

Input Tree:
         10
        /  \
       5    8
      / \
     2   20

In the above tree, nodes 20 and 8 must be swapped to fix the tree.  
Following is the output tree
         10
        /  \
       5    20
      / \
     2   8
