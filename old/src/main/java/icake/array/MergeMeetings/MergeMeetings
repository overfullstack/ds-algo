Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal. You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
To do this, youâ€™ll need to know when any team is having a meeting.
In HiCal, a meeting is stored as an object of a Meeting class with integer variables startTime and endTime.
These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
