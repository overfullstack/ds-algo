Let me first read the PathWithMinimumEffort.java file to understand the context and see how it's implemented:

Excellent question! The choice between using a `visited` set/array vs a `distance` array check depends on several factors. Let me break down the decision criteria:

## When to Use **`visited` Set/Array** (like PathWithMinimumEffort):

### ✅ **Use `visited` when:**

1. **Early Termination is Critical**
   ```java
   if (row == heights.length - 1 && col == heights[0].length - 1) {
       return maxEffortInPath; // Found target, exit immediately
   }
   ```
  - The problem allows stopping as soon as you reach the target
  - You don't need distances to ALL nodes, just to find the target

2. **Simple State Space**
  - Each position/node has a single "optimal" value to track
  - No need for complex comparisons or updates during processing

3. **Memory Efficiency**
  - `boolean` array uses less memory than `int` array for distance tracking
  - Important for large grids or graphs

4. **Algorithm Simplicity**
  - Cleaner code when you don't need the actual distance values
  - Process-once guarantee is sufficient

## When to Use **`distance` Array** (like optimized Dijkstra):

### ✅ **Use `distance` when:**

1. **Need Actual Distance Values**
   ```java
   // You need these values for further computation
   return distance[target]; // Return actual shortest distance
   ```

2. **Better Queue Pruning Required**
  - High edge density where queue can get bloated
  - Performance is critical and you want optimal pruning

3. **Multiple Path Updates**
  - Same node might be reached via multiple improving paths
  - Need to track and compare actual distance values

4. **Complex State Transitions**
  - The "cost" isn't just boolean reachability
  - Need to compare different costs to the same state

## **PathWithMinimumEffort Analysis:**

The `visited` approach works well here because:

```java
// ✅ Perfect for visited approach:
if (row == heights.length - 1 && col == heights[0].length - 1) {
    return maxEffortInPath; // Early termination!
}
```

**Why `visited` is chosen:**
- **Early termination**: Stop as soon as destination is reached
- **Single optimal path**: First time we reach destination = optimal (due to priority queue)
- **Memory efficient**: `boolean[][]` vs `int[][]`
- **Simple logic**: No need to compare effort values during processing

## **Decision Framework:**

```java
// Use VISITED when:
if (needEarlyTermination && singleOptimalValue && memoryMatters) {
    // Use visited set/array
    if (!visited[node]) {
        visited[node] = true;
        // process...
    }
}

// Use DISTANCE when:
if (needActualValues || complexUpdates || heavyPruningNeeded) {
    // Use distance array
    if (newDistance < distance[node]) {
        distance[node] = newDistance;
        // process...
    }
}
```

## **Quick Decision Guide:**

| Scenario | Use | Reason |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Find shortest path to target | `visited` | Early termination |
| Need all shortest distances | `distance` | Need actual values |
| Dense graph, performance critical | `distance` | Better pruning |
| Grid problems with target | `visited` | Memory + simplicity |
| Complex cost functions | `distance` | Need comparisons |

In **PathWithMinimumEffort**, the `visited` approach is optimal because we only care about reaching the destination with minimum effort, not computing efforts to all cells.
